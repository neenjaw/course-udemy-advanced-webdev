- transforms
- transitions
- keyframes

- [Waaark](https://waaark.com)
- [Species In Pieces](http://www.species-in-pieces.com)

They not always so flashy, even look at udemy.com

## But Why?

- [Improve the payment experience with animations](https://medium.com/bridge-collection/improve-the-payment-experience-with-animations-3d1b0a9b810e)

> The goal of animations should not solely be entertaining the user, but rather, they should be helping the user better understand whatâ€™s going on and how to use your product most effectively.

### They add context

They draw connections between behaviors and requirements.  They make things more visceral and accessibility.

### Slight of hand

Animations make the experience seem better, even if it is not, by giving the user something to focus on and illustrate the process rather than jarring transitions

### Button Transition

As actions change, buttons change

### Wrap up

It can lens your site in an air of professionalism.

> Getting things to move is easy, but planning how they should move is hard
