## But Why?

- [Improve the payment experience with animations](https://medium.com/bridge-collection/improve-the-payment-experience-with-animations-3d1b0a9b810e)

> The goal of animations should not solely be entertaining the user, but rather, they should be helping the user better understand whatâ€™s going on and how to use your product most effectively.

### They add context

They draw connections between behaviors and requirements.  They make things more visceral and accessibility.

### Slight of hand

Animations make the experience seem better, even if it is not, by giving the user something to focus on and illustrate the process rather than jarring transitions

### Button Transition

As actions change, buttons change

### Wrap up

It can lens your site in an air of professionalism.
