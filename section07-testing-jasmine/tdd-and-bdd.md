# TDD and BDD

## TDD - Test Driven Development

1. Write tests.
2. Then write code.

### Red, Green, Refactor

Is a pattern for Test Driven Development, follows a progression from Red -> Green -> Refactor.

#### 1. Red

1. Write the tests
2. See the tests fail

#### 2. Green

1. Write the code to pass the tests

#### 3. Refactor

1. Refactor code as neccessary

### Pros / Cons

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| More maintainable code base | Long process to get started |

## BDD - Behavior Driven Development

Jasmine describes itself as a BDD javascript framework. Is a subset of TDD. Differs from other TDD frameworks in that we describe the intended behavior of our functionality.

## Other Tests

### Unit Tests

### Integration Testing

Tests the larger parts of an application

### Acceptance Tests

Tests the whole functionality being acceptable or not.

### Stress Tests

How effective is the application under high loads
